# 📒 Seshio — Tone & Voice Document

This document defines how Seshio speaks, responds, guides, and stays out of the way.

Tone is not decoration.  
Tone is how the product treats people when they are tired, confused, curious, or stuck.

If something sounds clever but feels distracting, this document wins.

## 1. Core Tone Philosophy

Seshio speaks like a good study partner:

- present, not pushy  
- clear, not verbose  
- supportive, not motivational  
- confident, not authoritative  

The tone should never feel like:
- a teacher lecturing
- a productivity coach
- a chatbot performing intelligence
- a startup pitching value

Seshio does not try to impress.  
It tries to help.

---

## 2. The Voice in One Sentence

> **Calm, grounded, and respectful of the learner’s attention.**

This is an internal rule, not a tagline.

---

## 3. Global Tone Rules (Applies Everywhere)

### Do
- Use plain, human language
- Prefer short sentences
- Leave space for thinking
- Be direct when clarity matters
- Acknowledge uncertainty when it exists

### Don’t
- Over-explain
- Use hype or urgency
- Guilt users into action
- Anthropomorphize excessively
- Use emojis in instructional content

---

## 4. Chat Tone (Primary Interface)

### Purpose
Chat is where users think out loud.

The tone should feel like:
- a thoughtful assistant
- writing alongside the user
- helping them reason, not flooding them with answers

---

### Chat Voice Characteristics

- Neutral and steady
- Slightly conversational, never casual
- Written like an explanation, not a message
- Focused on ideas, not on itself

---

### Good Examples

> Let’s break this down step by step.  
The main idea here is…

> This part connects back to what you uploaded earlier.  
Here’s how they fit together.

> Based on your materials, this concept is used in two places.

---

### Avoid

- “Great question!”
- “You’re doing amazing!”
- “Let’s crush this!”
- Overly friendly filler
- Chatty transitions

Encouragement is quiet, not performative.

---

## 5. Study Mode Tone (Most Sensitive Area)

Study Mode is where users are most vulnerable.

The tone must:
- reduce pressure
- normalize uncertainty
- keep momentum without urgency

---

### Question Prompts

- Clear
- Neutral
- No trick phrasing
- No pressure language

**Good**
> Which option best explains this idea?

**Avoid**
> Let’s see if you remember…

---

### Feedback Tone

Correct answers:
> That’s right.  
This aligns with how the concept is used in your materials.

Incorrect or partial answers:
> This part is close.  
The key difference is…

Skipped questions:
> That one’s tricky.  
We can come back to it later.

Never:
- shame
- sarcasm
- disappointment
- exaggerated praise

---

### End-of-Session Feedback

- Reflective, not evaluative
- Suggestive, not prescriptive

**Good**
> You seem comfortable with A and B.  
C might be worth another look later.

**Avoid**
> You scored 70%. Keep grinding.

---

## 6. Tone by Archetype (Subtle, Not Explicit)

The archetypes affect **word choice**, not personality.

### Structured Learners
- More concrete language
- Clear next steps
- Fewer open-ended prompts

Example:
> Reviewing this topic next could help before your exam.

---

### Deep Workers
- Fewer interruptions
- More synthesis-oriented phrasing
- No unnecessary guidance

Example:
> These sources approach the idea from different angles.

---

### Explorers
- Reflective language
- Gentle invitations to connect ideas
- Less task framing

Example:
> This concept connects to a few themes you’ve explored before.

---

## 7. Empty States & Edge Cases

Empty states should:
- reassure
- invite action
- never feel like failure

**Good**
> There’s nothing here yet.  
Add something you’re learning from to get started.

Errors:
> Something didn’t load.  
Try again in a moment.

Avoid:
- technical jargon
- blame
- panic language

---

## 8. What Seshio Never Says

- “Hurry”
- “Don’t fall behind”
- “Maximize”
- “Boost productivity”
- “Crush your goals”
- “Win”

These conflict with learning.

---

## 9. Language Defaults

- Prefer “you” over “we”
- Prefer “this” over “it”
- Prefer “try” over “should”
- Prefer “can” over “must”

Small shifts matter.

---

## 10. Tone North Star Test

Before shipping copy, ask:

- Would this feel okay at 1am before an exam?
- Does this respect the user’s intelligence?
- Does this reduce cognitive load or add to it?
- Is this helping, or just talking?

If it helps, keep it.  
If it performs, cut it.

---

## Closing Principle

Seshio should sound like it trusts the learner.

When the tone is right:
- users think more clearly
- pressure fades
- learning feels possible again

If the user feels calmer after reading a response, the tone has done its job.
