## 🌟 Vision

To make learning feel lighter, clearer, and more human.

Seshio envisions a world where understanding is not rushed,  
where curiosity is supported instead of pressured,  
and where people feel capable of learning deeply without burning out.

Learning should not feel like a constant race.  
It should feel like progress that makes sense.

---

## 🎯 Mission

Seshio’s mission is to help people make sense of what they’re learning and study more effectively.

It does this by:
- Grounding understanding in the learner’s own materials  
- Helping turn raw information into clear explanations and notes  
- Supporting practice through reflection, questions, and feedback  
- Encouraging steady progress through small, focused sessions  

Seshio exists to help people **understand before they memorize**,  
and to support learning that lasts beyond the next test or deadline.

## 📜 Manifesto

### We believe learning should not feel heavy.

Not everything needs to be optimized.  
Not every moment needs to be measured.  
Not every learner needs to be pushed.

Most people are not lazy.  
They are overwhelmed.

---

### We believe understanding comes before performance.

Before grades.  
Before scores.  
Before outcomes.

When understanding is strong, performance follows naturally.  
When it isn’t, no amount of pressure helps.

---

### We believe tools should reduce friction, not add to it.

Learning already asks enough of people.  
The tools meant to help should not demand attention, discipline, or constant interaction.

Good tools stay out of the way.  
Great tools disappear when they’re doing their job well.

---

### We believe progress is built quietly.

In revisiting an idea.  
In seeing a connection.  
In noticing that something makes more sense than it did before.

Real progress doesn’t always look impressive.  
It just feels right.

---

### We believe AI should assist, not overwhelm.

AI should:
- Clarify
- Guide
- Support
- Adapt

It should never rush, judge, or replace the learner.

Intelligence is most useful when it is humble.

---

### We believe learning is personal.

Some people learn through structure.  
Some through exploration.  
Some through deep focus over time.

There is no single correct way to learn.  
Good systems adapt without asking learners to explain themselves.

---

### We believe rest is part of learning.

Stepping away is not failure.  
Returning with fresh eyes is not weakness.

Understanding often arrives after space.

---

### We believe trust matters.

Trust in the learner.  
Trust in the process.  
Trust that people want to understand, not just finish.

Seshio earns trust by being transparent, grounded, and respectful of attention.

---

## 🧭 Closing Principle

Seshio exists to make learning feel possible again.

If the product:
- Helps someone think more clearly
- Reduces pressure
- Supports curiosity
- Leaves the learner feeling capable

Then it is succeeding.

Everything else is secondary.

## 🔬 Research & Experiments

Seshio is designed as a learning platform **and** an applied machine learning project.

This section tracks ongoing and planned experiments focused on improving study quality, retrieval accuracy, and learning outcomes.

The goal is not model novelty for its own sake, but measurable improvements to understanding and recall.

### 🎯 Research Goals

- Improve how well retrieved context supports understanding
- Measure and optimize study quality, not just answer relevance
- Adapt study sessions based on learner performance over time
- Explore lightweight personalization without overfitting

### 🧪 Experiment Areas

#### Retrieval Quality
- Compare pure vector search vs hybrid retrieval (semantic + lexical)
- Evaluate chunking strategies and window sizes
- Measure retrieval precision and recall on study questions
- Test shallow re-ranking models for relevance improvement

#### Answer & Study Quality
- Use LLM-based evaluation to score answers on:
  - Groundedness
  - Clarity
  - Completeness
  - Usefulness for studying
- Compare different prompt strategies for explanations vs recall
- Track how often answers correctly reference source material

#### Study Mode Effectiveness
- Analyze quiz performance over time
- Measure improvement across repeated sessions
- Track which concepts cause repeated difficulty
- Experiment with adaptive difficulty and spacing strategies

#### Feedback-Driven Learning
- Log anonymous interaction signals (e.g. quiz accuracy, retries)
- Use feedback to adjust retrieval weighting and quiz generation
- Explore simple mastery estimation models per topic

### 📊 Evaluation Strategy

Experiments are evaluated using a mix of:
- Automated metrics (retrieval scores, coverage, latency)
- Model-based judgments (LLM-as-judge for study usefulness)
- Behavioral signals (quiz accuracy, concept repetition)

All evaluation focuses on whether Seshio helps learners:
- Understand material faster
- Retain concepts more reliably
- Identify gaps in knowledge earlier

### 🧠 Experimental Approach

Research in Seshio focuses on how different modeling and retrieval strategies affect real learning outcomes.

Experiments explore:
- Classical vs semantic vs hybrid retrieval
- Re-ranking strategies and relevance scoring
- Answer quality and grounding evaluation
- Adaptive quiz difficulty and concept mastery estimation

The goal is to identify which approaches genuinely improve understanding and recall, not just model performance.

All experiments are designed to be reproducible, comparable, and incrementally integrated into the product.

### 🧩 Research Philosophy

Research in Seshio is guided by a simple principle:

> If an experiment does not make learning clearer or studying more effective, it does not ship.

Progress is measured in understanding, not metrics alone.

## 🔄 Adaptive by Design

Seshio is built to support different ways of learning, from structured coursework to deep research and open-ended exploration.

The core experience stays the same, but the app adapts through organization, language, and study flow based on how someone is using it at a given moment.

This allows Seshio to feel welcoming and useful whether you're:
- Studying for classes
- Working through research
- Exploring ideas out of curiosity

No separate modes. No rigid paths.
Just a system that meets learners where they are.
